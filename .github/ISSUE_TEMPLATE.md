    information, we can't help you as well.

If this is a FEATURE REQUEST, please:
  - Describe *in detail* the feature/behavior/change you'd like to see.

In both cases, be ready for followup questions, and please respond in a timely
manner.  If we can't reproduce a bug or think a feature already exists, we

explain why.
